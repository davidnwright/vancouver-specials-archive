This is an exhibit of Vancouver Special-style houses in, of all places, Vancouver, B.C. The exhibit asks viewers to think about the differences inherent in looking at similarity. While all these houses follow the same general design, there are differences in here that correspond to how we might think about thematic study. In other words, the exhibit asks the viewer to think about how we often understand supposedly "collective" designs--be they cultural, political, racial, economic, or otherwise located in ritual and repetition--differently.
